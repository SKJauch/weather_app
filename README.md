# Weather Application

Weather Application designed so that a user can search by city to see the current and forecasted weather for that city. 

The weather information included in the results for the current weather are:  

- City name  
- Current date  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Wind Speed  

The weather information included in the results for the 5 day forecast are:

- City name
- Future date of forecast
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Wind Speed

For all results, there will be an icon representing the weather conditions.  

Recent search results will be shown on the page and when the user clicks on a previously searched city, the current and forecasted conditions will again be displayed.
